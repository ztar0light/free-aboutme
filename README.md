# free-aboutme

Welcome to the `free-aboutme` repo. This is a repository where a template for an 'about me' website is posted for free use by everyone who wishes to use it. All of the HTML file (the file that tells the browser the content it needs to display) will contain simple commenting and formatting in order to make it easy for somebody who doesn't understand HTML to edit it and make it their own.

The CSS stylesheets, that tell the website how to display the information detailed by the HTML, are also commented appropriately in order to allow users to edit the colours of their website.

Different styles of webpage will also be uploaded eventually.

## Extra Instructions

Under the assets folder, you will find two files titled `favicon.ico` and `pfp.png`. The favicon goes as the little icon on the tab, and the pfp is for at the top of the page. Both of the placeholders are just black pngs that have been named appropriately. You are to feel free to upload your own files and then rename them correctly. Just keep in mind that you have to convert whatever file you are using for the icon from `.png` to `.ico`.

Please also be careful when editing all the files to ensure you don't delete anything. We don't claim any responsibility if you break it, but do let us know if there are any bugs in the `.html`.
