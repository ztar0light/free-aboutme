# free-aboutme

Welcome to the `free-aboutme` repo. This is a repository where a template for an 'about me' website is posted for free use by everyone who wishes to use it. All of the HTML file (the file that tells the browser the content it needs to display) will contain simple commenting and formatting in order to make it easy for somebody who doesn't understand HTML to edit it and make it their own.

The CSS stylesheets, that tell the website how to display the information detailed by the HTML, are also commented appropriately in order to allow users to edit the colours of their website.

Different styles of webpage will also be uploaded eventually.

### Terminology
